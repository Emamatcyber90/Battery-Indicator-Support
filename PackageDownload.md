<h1>Package Download</h1>

## Background / Explanation

I've always wanted to offer the APK package (the runnable version of
the app) for download from this site, but I've always been a little
afraid it would cost me sales.  I've decided that it is worth doing.

It is definitely best to get the app through the Google Play Store if
possible, but there are several situations where it might be useful to
download it from here.  For example:

* If you do not have access to the Google Play Store in your country or you are using a custom build of Android without the Google Play Store.
* If the price I'm asking in the Google Play Store is more than you think is fair.
* If you need more than 15 minutes to decide if the price I'm asking is worth it.

Benefits of downloading from the Google Play Store rather than this site include:

* Automatic updates.
* You increase the number of downloads/installs and can rate and review, all of which help the ranking of the app.

Therefore, even if you initially download the app from here to try it
out, please consider purchasing it from the Google Play Store if you can.

If you do download it from here, please consider supporting
development with a donation of whatever amount you feel is
appropriate.

## Support / Donate

Donations of any size are appreciated. (Honestly! I really won't judge
you if it's a relatively small amount.  On the contrary, I'll be
grateful that you chose to support my project.)

Remember, as discussed above, that purchasing from the Google Play Store
is one of the best forms of support.

To be very clear: this is a for-profit business, not a non-profit, so
your donation is _not_ tax-deductible.  I use the word "donate" to
mean that you are voluntarily supporting development rather than
buying the product at a fixed price (or not).  I'm running my business
a bit differently than is common by sharing the source code publicly
and offering the packages for download here.

If you like that idea, please support it!

To donate via PayPal, you can use this button and choose your
donation amount on the next page.  I believe but am not certain that
this works even if you don't have a PayPal account (I think you can
just enter your credit card details without creating an account.)

If you prefer to donate in a currency other than US dollars, you can
use PayPal to send it to the email address (android [at] darshancomputing.com).

## Download APK Packages

Some folks may prefer the free version, since it's smaller and
simpler.  Since not everyone has access to the Google Play Store, here it
is: https://github.com/darshan-/Battery-Indicator-Free/releases

And finally, the Pro version that most of you are probably interested
in: https://github.com/darshan-/Battery-Indicator-Pro/releases

You'll have to manually check back here from time to time to see if
there's an update.  As always, the
[Changelog](http://code.google.com/p/battery-indicator/wiki/Changelog?tm=6)
is useful for deciding if it's worth updating.
