== Pro Version ==

v4.0.2
 * Re-enable Cupcake support.

v4.0.1 (_Translations_)
 * Due to a bug in the web translation interface, many languages lost a few important translations.  The bug is now fixed, and the translations are back in this release.
 * Updated French and Italian translations.

v4.0.0
 * Initial support for Honeycomb tablets. There are more tablet optimizations planned, but this is a good start.
 * Several updated translations.
 * Automatically detect when preference summaries use a Formatter; removed manual configuration option so users don't have to deal with this.  It should "just work" now.
 * Unfortunately, I had to remove Cupcake (Android 1.5) support in order to add Honeycomb support. The reasons are complicated, annoying, and out of my control. Cupcake users can still use the previous version.

v3.1.5 (_Translations and Bugfix_)
 * Initial Czech, Hungarian, and Slovak translations.
 * Fix a Force Close bug that might have happened when connecting certain car chargers, and possibly in other situations.

v3.1.4 (_Translations_)
 * Initial French translations.

v3.1.3 (_Translations_)
 * Fixed Chinese translations for Hong Kong users

v3.1.2 (_Bugfix_)
 * This release provides a workaround for a bug in CyanogenMod. If you use CyanogenMod and get a Force Close when editing certain Battery Indicator settings, after upgrading you should go to Other Settings (in this app) and select the setting for *Summaries Use Formatter*.

v3.1.1 (_Bugfix_)
 * Someone managed to put a _null_ String in a place I thought one couldn't show up.  Fixed now.

v3.1.0
 * Alarms: With the new alarm feature, the app can now notify you when your battery becomes full, when the charge drops below or rises above a chosen level, if the temperature rises above a chosen level, or if the battery health fails.
 * (_Translation_) Partial French translations.
 * (_Translation_) Updated Italian translations.
 * (_Translation_) Fix error in Simplified Chinese translations.

v3.0.6 (_Translations_)
 * (_Translation_) Add Italian translations.

v3.0.5 (_Translations_)
 * (_Translation_) Fix Traditional Chinese translations.

v3.0.4 (_Translations_)
 * (_Translation_) Add Spanish translations.
 * (_Translation_) Add Traditional Chinese translations.

v3.0.3
 * (_Bugfix_) Remove FLAG_ACTIVITY_RESET_TASK_IF_NEEDED from Intent used to launch Battery Use screen. It doesn't appear to be necessary, and it caused a problem on at least one user's phone (which is a Droid X, but don't know if that's relevant).
 * (_Bugfix_) Some phones fluctuate wildly in their reported charge.  This causes Battery Indicator to think either that the phone has been charged or that a fuller battery has been put in.  I've adjusted the threshold to hopefully work well both for those with phones that fluctuate and for those who carry spare batteries.  With this version, a jump of 30 points or more is guaranteed to trip the switch, while a jump of 20 points or fewer is guaranteed not to. (For 21-29, it just depends on the situation).
 * (_Translation_) Add Chinese translations.

v3.0.2 (_Bugfix_)
 * (_Bugfix_) Auto-disable keyguard properly: User has to manually dismiss the keyguard once, then it will be disabled. This is both more secure (for secure screen locks) and fixes a bug that was present in various forms with all screen locks (including 'None').
 * (_Bugfix_) Make sure database is always closed properly.

v3.0.1
 * Log temperature and voltage, too.
 * Ability to export logs to CSV on SD card.
 * Option to close main window immediately after launching Battery Use screen.
 * Option to disallow manual lock screen disable.
 * A handful of minor tweaks and improvements throughout.

v3.0.0
 * Estimated discharge / charge time left. (Optional)
 * Logging of battery state. (Optional)
 * Themes for the main window. (Optional)
 * Manually/automatically dis/reenable the device lock screen. (Optional)
 * Efficiency improvements throughout.
 * Actually _smaller_ despite all the new features.
 * A "soft reset" of the service when you change settings, so the icon doesn't blink.
 * Green down to 20% (previous limit was 30%).
 * It now notices if a fuller battery has been put in, or if the phone was charged while off.
 * Trimmed down interface, moving many things to a menu.
 * So many new settings that they've been broken into multiple, easier to use pages.
 * Help pages explaining all of the settings.
 * Option to show the charge as larger text (only in notification tray).
 * Color preview.

== Free Version ==
