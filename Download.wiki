== Background / Explanation ==

I've always wanted to offer the APK package (the runnable version of
the app) for download from this site, but I've always been a little
afraid it would cost me sales.  Consider this a trial run: I'm very
glad to finally offer these downloads, but if there's a noticable
decline in sales, I'll have to take this page down.

It is definitely best to get the app through the Android Market if
possible, but there are several situations where it might be useful to
download it from here.  For example:

 * If you do not have access to the Android Market in your country or you are using a custom build of Android without the Android Market.
 * If the price I'm asking in the Android Market is more than you think is fair.
 * If you need more than 15 minutes to decide if the price I'm asking is worth it.

Benefits of downloading from the Android Market rather than this site include:
 * Automatic updates.
 * You increase the number of downloads/installs and can rate and review, all of which help the ranking of the app.

Therefore, even if you initially download the app from here to try it
out, please consider purchasing it from the Market if you can.

If you do download it from here, please consider supporting
development with a donation of whatever amount you feel is
appropriate.

== Download APK Packages ==

Some folks may prefer the free version, since it's smaller and
simpler.  Since not everyone has access to the Android Market, here it
is:
[http://battery-indicator.googlecode.com/files/BatteryIndicator-4.1.1.apk BatteryIndicator-4.1.1.apk]

And finally, the Pro version that most of you are probably interested
in:
[http://battery-indicator.googlecode.com/files/BatteryIndicatorPro-5.1.3.apk BatteryIndicatorPro-5.1.3.apk]

You'll have to manually check back here from time to time to see if
there's an update.  As always, the Changelog is useful for deciding if
it's worth updating.
